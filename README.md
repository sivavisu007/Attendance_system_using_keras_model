**Attendance System Using Face and ID Card Verification**
This project is an automated attendance system that uses face recognition and ID card verification to mark student attendance. It leverages machine learning models to verify the identity of students and logs their attendance in an Excel sheet. The system also sends email notifications to students and administrators regarding attendance status.

**Features**
Face Recognition: Captures and verifies the student's face using a pre-trained Keras model.
ID Card Verification: Captures and verifies the student's ID card using a pre-trained Keras model.
Attendance Logging: Logs attendance in an Excel file with timestamps.
Email Notifications: Sends email alerts to students and administrators for attendance status (Present, Late, Absent, or On Leave).
Deadline Management: Automatically finalizes attendance after a specified deadline.
Professional Email Format: Sends well-structured and professional emails to students and admins.

**Prerequisites**
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
    
    Python 3.8 or higher
    Required Python libraries (install using pip install -r requirements.txt)
